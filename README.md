# Machine-Learning-Using-Covid-Dataset
This repository consists of Machine Learning models using Covid dataset. Here I have discovered Machine Learning models like Random Forrest Classifier, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and GausianNB.
<br>
The Dataset consists of 100k rows of coronavirus cases as well as deaths in different states of USA. I have modified the dataset and reduced the number of rows from 100k to 30k in order to have a better compution.
